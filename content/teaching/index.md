### Backstepping designs on complex nonlinear systems
MR8500 - PhD Topics in Marine Control Systems, NTNU, 2020  
**Abstract**: An intensive lecture is given showing how thousands of theoretical papers on backstepping designs can be understood
in 2+2 hours.  
<!-- **Hightlights**:
- Introduce 6 elegant methods:
    1. Dynamic surface control and commanded filters,
    2. Finite-time control,
    3. Neural network and fuzzy logic system,
    4. Nussbaum function,
    5. Barrier Lyapunov function,
    6. Hyperbolic tangent function.
- Apply the elegant methods to a class of systems, including state constraints, input nonlinearities (input saturation/deadzone/time-varying control coefficient), unknown disturbance, time-delay effects, purefeedback system, event-triggered systems, stochastic systems.
- Apply the elegant methods to complex systems, including the underactuated system, switched system, and multi-agent
consensus system -->
